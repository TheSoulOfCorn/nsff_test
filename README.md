# NSFF IMPLEMENTATION for UCSD_CSE274_PROJ
##### By Mohan Li, EMAIL: mol002@ucsd.edu   

## FOR MILESTONE2
This part is for the requirements of project milestone for CSE274.   
- Currently only some preliminary results as below, sorry for that code is not organized yet.
- For next step, I would like to:   
Try to figure out the dynamic distortion (shown in the video below)   
More training on different scene   
More testing on different settings (fix time/view/neither, calibrate camera path etc.)     
- others   
This will be my final project presentation. Nerf/mipnerf will be part of my paper presentation instead.
